# HR-Analytics
Here in this Project I have analysed the Company data to find the factors responsible for the attrition of the employees.
First the dataset is loaded in Power BI and then using Power Query cleaned and transformed for eg. cleaning, checking for duplicates, null values, New columns etc.
Then using report view the data is visualized using various charts and calculations eg. attrition Rate etc.
Also slicer is added in the department column so that the data is appropriately visualized.
